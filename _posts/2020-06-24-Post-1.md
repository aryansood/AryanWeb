title: "Self driving cars using genetic algorithm and Unity3d"
---

Inspired by some videos using AI in games I decided to create something like that myself. Having study previously something in the domain of genetic algorithm I decided to create this project. (I really enjoyed learning unity3d and C# as I know about this thing but never learned them)

So, first of all, I created the mind of the cars, a neural network that has an input layer, 2 hidden layers, and the output layer as in the image below, the input layer consists of 5 nodes(the inputs) which are the distance between the cars and the circuit as the image below shows, then in the output layer, we have 2 nodes which represents the acceleration of the car and the amount change in rotation of the car.
